The HYPERNETS project has developed a new hyperspectral radiometer integrated in automated 
networks of water and land bidirectional reflectance measurements for satellite validation.
A detailed uncertainty budget was measured in the lab for these instruments, and these uncertainties 
are propagated from product to product using the CoMet toolkit within the hypernets_processor. 
All HYPERNETS products are provided as obsarray-compatible digital effects tables. For the HYPERNETS
vicarious calibration study, the uncertainties in these files are also propagated to TOA using punpy.

## ❔ What is HYPERNETS?

The HYPERNETS project has developed a new hyperspectral radiometer integrated in automated networks of water and land bidirectional reflectance measurements for satellite validation. 

## ❕ How is the CoMet Toolkit contributing to HYPERNETS?

A detailed uncertainty budget was measured in the lab for the HYPERNETS instruments. These uncertainties were then propagated from product to product using the CoMet Toolkit within the hypernets_processor. 

All HYPERNETS products are provided as obsarray-compatible digital effects tables. For the HYPERNETS vicarious calibration study, the uncertainties in these files are also propagated to TOA using punpy.

Rasma joined Climate and Earth Observations group at the National Physical Laboratory as a graduate research scientist in September 2023, right after completing an MSc in Environmental Science and Policy, with a focus on climate change at King's College London. Prior to this, Rasma obtained a BSc in Physics from Royal Holloway University of London.  During her postgraduate degree, Rasma completed an Air Quality Assessment internship at NPL which inspired her to pursue a further career in the company. Her master's thesis was focusing on the recovery and characterisation of microplastics across UK beaches, solidifying interest in researching environmental issues.

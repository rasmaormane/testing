## ❔ What is CoMet Toolkit?

  **Community Metrology** (CoMet) **Toolkit** is a set of software tools that can handle, process, and store measurement data uncertainties.

  A notable feature of this toolkit lies in its abilities to deal with the complexities of combining individual uncertainties from various sources. It not only propagates the final combined uncertainties but also provides information about the error-correlation. 

## 💡 Why is CoMet Toolkit relevant?

  To ensure credible and reliable interpretation of data, the associated uncertainty information ought to be provided. Oftentimes it is made up of a multitude of sources combined through the processing chain. Each source affects the final product at varying levels.
  
  CoMet Toolkit accounts for case- and source-specific characteristics of the measurements. It can handle data that involves:

- temporal or spatial averaging
- combining random and systemic uncertainties
- handling random and systemic uncertainties separately
- _many more_

## 📋 What can CoMet Toolkit be used for?

  CoMet toolkit can be used to:
  
- quantify uncertainties (fully correlated or uncorrelated)
- create digital effects table
- calculate the uncertainty budget
- validate measurements
  
  for datasets of various sizes. 
  
  Initially, CoMet was developed to fulfil the Quality Assurance framework for Earth Observation (QA4EO) requirements. According to these guidelines, all Satellite Earth Observations (EO) and in-situ measurements require their corresponding uncertainty information. 
  
  Despite its origins, CoMet can be applied to any field that requires measurement uncertainty propagation. 

## 📍 Where can CoMet Toolkit be accessed?

The UK National Earth Observation Conference 2022 â€“ the premier annual event for the 
Earth Observation, Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry community took place on the 6-8th 
September 2022, providing a great opportunity for people to meet, network and learn 
about the latest developments in scientific research and space-enabled technology.
The CoMet toolkit was presented in a session on "Python for Earth Observation and 
Climate Sciences", which was an excellent fit. There was significant interest in 
our toolkit, and it was also very interesting to see all the other work people 
are doing in python for EO.

The Very High-resolution Radar & Optical Data Assessment (VH-RODA) will provide an 
open forum (for the new space, commercial and institutional space sectors) for 
presenting and discussing about the current status and future developments related to 
Earth Observation (EO) data quality, calibration and validation of space-borne 
very high-resolution SAR and Optical sensors and data products, with a dedicated focus 
on commercial EO data providers and related Cal/Val activities, synergies between optical 
and SAR communities, presentation of standards and best practices for data quality.
Uncertainties are of paramount importance to this field, and the CoMet toolkit could be
a very useful tool for this community.

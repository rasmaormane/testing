Welcome ðŸ‘‹

In this brief guide we will walk you through the basic steps and prerequisists to get started with CoMet. 

1.ðŸ’¡ Get familiar with the toolkit and its capabilitites. 

All the relevant information regarding the aims and functionality of CoMet Tolkit is outlined in the [**About Section**](about/). 

But, in a nutshell, CoMet stands for **Community Metrology Toolkit** and it a set of software tools that handle, process, and store measurement data uncertainties.

It accounts for case- and source-specific characteristics of the measurements, and can be used to quantify uncertainties and the uncertainty budget, create digital effects tables, and overall validate measurements. 

At this time, there are three separate tools:

  1. comet_maths
  2. obsarray
  3. punpy

but more modules are planned to be developed and included in the future. For more detail, refer to the [**Tools Section**](/#tools). 

2. Identify your uncertainty estimation goals and look through the toolkit documentation and examples
